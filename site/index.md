My goal is to help students become great computer scientists.
On the research front,
  I work towards this goal with my [students](students.html)
  in [PLSE], [SAMPL], and [ADA].
On the education front,
  I work towards this goal by [teaching courses](teaching.html)
  on programming languages and related topics.
I am also part of the incredible team at [OctoML].

My expertise is rooted in formal verification,
  especially of compilers.
As my students develop their own research vision,
  we branch out across diverse domains.
Our work is unified by themes of
  making it easier to write tricky programs and
  figuring out how to ensure such code is correct.
We rigorously prove our results and
  always build real, working systems[^1].
Some of the domains we have explored include:

- CAD Tools for 3D Printing and Carpentry
- Automatic Numerical Accuracy Improvement
- Machine Learning Compilers and Runtimes
- Web Browser Layout Verification
- Radiotherapy Control Verification
- Distributed Systems Verification
- Internet Router Verification
- Compiler Optimization Synthesis

Check out our
  [projects](projects.html),
  [publications](publications.html), and
  [talks](talks.html) for more!

      formalism and empiricism as "both Greek and graphs". &nbsp;
